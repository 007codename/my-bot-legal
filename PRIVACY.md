1. **Data Collected**
   - The Bot may collect and store basic Discord information such as:
     - User IDs
     - Server IDs
     - Message content (only if necessary for commands or features)
   - No personal information outside of Discord is collected.

2. **How Data is Used**
   - Data is used only to provide Bot functionality (e.g., moderation, commands, or server-specific features).
   - Data is never sold or shared with third parties.

3. **Data Storage**
   - Data may be stored temporarily in memory or in a database.
   - Data is kept only as long as necessary for the Botâ€™s features.
   - Users may request deletion of their data by contacting the Bot owner.

4. **Third-Party Services**
   - The Bot does not share data with external services unless explicitly stated.

5. **Security**
   - Reasonable efforts are made to protect data, but no method is 100% secure.

If you have questions or concerns, contact the Bot owner directly via Discord.
